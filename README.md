# Repository for CPSC 4300 Quarterback Study

## File Structure

*Scraping_Scripts*
  - All the scraping scripts that we wrote.
  - If you want to run these, I'm pretty sure they all use Python 3. 
  - If you run these, a csv file will be added to this folder with the data, so make sure that you delete it before pushing your code to the repo
  
*Scraped_Data*
  All the csv files that we created from our scraping scripts
  
*EDA*
  An additional folder with all of our names are in this so we can all post our EDA and see each others
  
*Junk*
  Folder for stuff I don't think/know if we need, but didn't want to delete
